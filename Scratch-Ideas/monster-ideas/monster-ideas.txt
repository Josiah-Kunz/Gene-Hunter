Cow-like beast:
	- Aleph (semitic word for ox; how we and the greeks get "alpha" in "alphabet")
		= Could also do something like "Yox"
	- Binox
		= Two horns or maybe two heads?
	- Aurox
		= aurum is latin for gold, so maybe do a golden bull thing?
		= steel/??? ground? grass?
	
Wasp/butterfly hybrid
	- Lures its prey with its beautiful stinger
	- Nature [locked]
	- Fire (that's how it feels when it stings you)
	- Air (its wings are prominent features)
	- Poison
	- Could this be only obtainable as a "fourth" stage via gene splicing from two other Monsters? Would be a neat example of an evolution line that converges. Kinda the opposite of Nincada.
	- Acquire via small egg/s from a gift/found in special area
	- Signature move: Second Metamorphosis (requires 3/4 affinities points in Nature?)
	
Enchanted forest:
	- Black kitten -> evo: lithe black cat (speed)
		= Void/Magic (both locked)
	- Owl
		= Air [locked]/Magic
	- Rabbit
		= Ground [locked]/Magic
		= trans/cisdimensional portals early (because digging and disappearing and rabbit out of the hat)
	- Fox
		= Magic [locked]/Fire; Ground
	- Skunk
		= Toxic [locked]/Fire; Ground (do skunks burrow?)
	- Squirrel
		= All unlocked --- Nature (b/c trees); Air (b/c flying); Magic
	- Luna Moth
		= All unlocked --- Light/Air/Void
	
Phasmid tribe: +stealth
	- stick bug
	- mantis
	
Deer, but with a dragon's butt
	- baby white tailed deer spots turn into scales + spikes
	- nature/fire
	- pokemon had a good idea in sawsbuck (antlers are cool), but flame antlers would be even cooler
	
Flowery Woods in Kirby 
	- Actually, a lot of mechanics from Kirby seem to fit, like Beetle Kirby
