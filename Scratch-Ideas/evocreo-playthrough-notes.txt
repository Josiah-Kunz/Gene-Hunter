	- Beginning play (<10 levels) almost lost me. The mechanics just aren't 
		fun. The movement is grid-based. The houses are too big, so you only 
		see one on the screen at a time. It makes the world seem sectioned,
		disrupts flow, and discourages exploration.
	- Having only 8 elemental types is probably a good call. It's tough enough
		to learn them with dual typing.
	- Having a guy with lvl 50 Creo when you only have level 25 is a neat thing.
		Something to look forward to.
