		\item{Electric might be the best attacker, though, with Ice as also good}
		\item{Magic and Martial suck as attackers, but that's okay}
		\item{Earth and Void might be the best defenders, but Metal, Nature, and Water are good, too}
		\item{Some types have an immunity, but Electric is healed by other Electric Types instead of damaged}

	Note: Types may be found, analyzed, and modified using an EditorUtilityWidget found under \texttt{Content/Editor/Type-Advantage}, right-clicking the \texttt{TypeAdvantages} widget, and selecting \texttt{Run Editor Utility Widget}.

\sect{Data}
The raw data acquired from the statistics tab of the type advantages UI (see Figure~\ref{fig:stats-ui}) can be found under the ``Type-Matchup-Statistics-Copy'' folder. They're formatted as .tex tables in case I ever wanted to print them, but they can be opened up with any text editor (think Notepad). I don't recommend parsing through it unless you're looking for something specific. For example, the 2v2 data has 126 entries. The full data is always available by running the UI as seen in the figure below.

The following sub-sections list data. The Type numbers in parentheses are the sum of advantages\footnote{or resists, or disadvantages, or whatever.} of single- and dual-Type defenders. For example, in the first sub-section, Fire has 4 single advantages and 68 dual advantages for a total of 72 Types.


\subsect{Attacking}



When attacking, ``best'' is defined as most effective and ``worst'' is defined as the most resisted. In practice, these may not so easily be defined.



\subsubsect{Best Single-Type Attackers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Fire (72)}
	\item{Electric (69)}
	\item{Ice (69)}
	\item{Earth (63)}
	\item{Void (63)}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsect{Best Dual-Type Attackers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Earth + Ice (132)}
	\item{Electric + Void (132)}
	\item{Fire + Nature (129)}
	\item{Earth + Electric (128)}
	\item{Ice + Void (128)}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Note: not surprisingly, these are just combinations of the best single-Type attackers plus Nature.

\subsubsect{Worst Single-Type Attackers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Toxic (92)}
	\item{Sound (86)}
	\item{Nature (80)}
	\item{Fire (72)}
	\item{Earth (69)}
	\item{Martial (69)}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsect{Worst Dual-Type Attackers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Fire + Sound (53)}
	\item{Fire + Martial (44)}
	\item{Earth + Void (41)}
	\item{Nature + Toxic (35)}
	\item{Earth + Sound (34)}
\end{itemize}
