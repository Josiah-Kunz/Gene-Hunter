\sect{Static Corporeal Data}

This section refers to data that is a part of the 3D world for Monsters that cannot be changed in-game, such as a Monster's model or hitboxes.

\subsect{Renderer}
The renderer is how the Monster looks in the 3D world. This includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{3D model}
	\item{Particle effects for, e.g., breathing, footfall, smoke from Fire Types, etc.}
	\item{Animations and their controller}
	\item{A mapping of body parts to specific locations (e.g., does this Monster have a ``mouth''? If so, where is it?)}
	\item{Height and weight distributions (which can slightly influence the 3D model via scaling)}
\end{itemize}

\subsect{Colliders}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Foot colliders}
	\item{Interaction colliders}
	\item{Hitboxes}
\end{itemize}

\subsect{Combat World UI}
Note: combat canvas UI (such as the player's attack buttons) are not included here as they are not attached to the Monster.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{World nameplate}
	\item{Floating damage numbers (for getting hit)}
\end{itemize}

\subsect{SFX}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{General sounds (e.g., footfall)}
	\item{Non-combat sounds (e.g., idle)}
	\item{Combat sounds (e.g., attacking)}
\end{itemize}
