\sect{Static Incorporeal Data}

This section refers to any facets that are not physically present in the 3D world for Monsters, such as their move pool or affinities.

\subsect{Taxonomy}
This includes a Monster's Tribe, Genus, and Species (but not nickname, since that may be changed in-game). For example, Void Rhino's taxonomy is $|$ Beast (Tribe) $|$ Behemoth (Genus) $|$ Void Rhino (Species) $|$ Kenny (nickname).
