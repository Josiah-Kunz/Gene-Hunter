\sect{What Is a Projectile?}

A Projectile is a Actor Blueprint. It contains:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{A \code{UProjectileMove} that marries the physical Projectile with \code{MoveData}. This has required\\\code{UActorComponent}s:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{\code{UProjectileDirection} to set the Projectile's direction (either initially or over time)}
			\item{\code{UProjectileSpeed} to set the Projectile's speed (either initially or over time)}
			\item{\code{UProjectilePhysics} to control things like bounciness}
			\item{\code{UProjectileDamage} to control how the damage is doled out (e.g., single use vs multiple use)}
			\item{\code{UProjectileEndBehavior} to control what happens when the Projectile's use comes to an end}
		\end{itemize}
		These components are elaborated upon in upcoming sections.
	}
	\item{A \code{UProjectileMovementComponent} that controls how it moves. This should not normally be altered since its settings are more flexibly set by the aforementioned components.}
	\item{The Projectile's visuals}
	\item{The Projectile's collider}
\end{itemize}
\noindent Of course, there might be other things there too for custom purposes. An additional note is that the \code{MoveData} is what decides the spawn location (via \code{UActorSpawnScheme}s).
