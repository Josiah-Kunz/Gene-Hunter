Disclaimer: currently in development for educational purposes only. I have offered college level classes in game development and have developed games for eduational research. IF (and that's a big "if") this project becomes anything more, all software educational licenses will be immediately suspended and commercial licenses will be acquired. However, that is not the intention at this point in time.
