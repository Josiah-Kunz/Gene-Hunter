Woohoo! Research video game "Lost Student" is done. We're collecting student 
data now. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot. Boy, I wish I didn't have
that time crunch though. I really should've gone back and reworked several 
systems (the jump/grounded system for sure). But hey, it's done. And Gene Hunter
won't be my "first game". (Technically, Phoenix Rising was my first game to be
published, but I didn't follow that one til the bitter end.)

I've also added a couple of games to my list for inspiration. The mobile game
Slice & Dice is excellent, and atypical for mobile games. I just might pattern
GH after it. Also, I've picked up EvoCreo again after 10(?) years away from it.
There are updates, and I really should take notes.

Anyway, I'm excited to be back in the saddle. We'll see, though---this project
has always been a bit of a pipe dream.
