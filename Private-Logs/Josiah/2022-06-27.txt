Wow---three months of no activity! Get ready for excuses:

The end of the semester got kinda crazy. We're adding an engineering major and 
yours truly is supposed to spearhead it. I had to make a conscious choice to 
prioritize work over fun. After that, summer research got in full swing. We're 
making a 2D pixel platformer that utilize special relativity rules (such as 
length contraction). It's fun, it's in Unity, and my two students (an art
student and a CS student) are great. It also lets me learn more practical skills
on the hobby I enjoy most---developing video games.

Unit tests are going well. I'm rejuvinated to see them working. I bet my past
self left the Blueprints in a mess, though.
